# General Ideas about use of BN
We want to represent the diagnosis and treatment knowledgebase as a BN

For a given patient, we will have given diagnostic information, demographic information, tumor genotype information, etc.

## Medical Diagnosis
- primary tumor size
- primary tumor location
- invasive properties

## Tumor Genetics and Biomarkers
- genetic subtype
- presence of different cell surface receptors
- expression info from stroma (classified --> outcome?)


## Metastasis Info (how to model multiple metastatic locations?)
- # of metastasis
- location
- size?

## Patient Demographics
- age
- sex
- ethnicity
- height
- weight

## Patient Health Metrics
- Blood pressure + other vital signs
- Overall health assessment?

## Treatment Options
- Chemo
- Surgical
- Radiology
- other?

## Outcome Variables
- Quality of Life
- Prognosis (remission vs. recurrance)


The results of putting in known info/ selecting type of treatment etc. on q of life and prognosis could be informative for decision-making.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
