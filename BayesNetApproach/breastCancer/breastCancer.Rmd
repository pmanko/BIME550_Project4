# General Ideas about use of BN
We want to represent the diagnosis and treatment knowledgebase as a BN

For a given patient, we will have given diagnostic information, demographic information, tumor genotype information, etc.

## Medical Diagnosis
- primary tumor size
- primary tumor location
- invasive properties

## Tumor Genetics and Biomarkers
- genetic subtype
- presence of different cell surface receptors
- expression info from stroma (classified --> outcome?)


## Metastasis Info (how to model multiple metastatic locations?)
- # of metastasis
- location
- size?

## Patient Demographics
- age
- sex
- ethnicity
- height
- weight

## Patient Health Metrics
- Blood pressure + other vital signs
- Overall health assessment?

## Treatment Options
- Chemo
- Surgical
- Radiology
- other?

## Outcome Variables
- Quality of Life
- Prognosis (remission vs. recurrance)


The results of putting in known info/ selecting type of treatment etc. on q of life and prognosis could be informative for decision-making.
